# Bike-bazaar-etlproject

## Overview

This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to process and manage bike sale data. The pipeline extracts data from various sources, transforms it to meet business requirements, and loads it into a destination database for further analysis and reporting.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Extracts bike sale data from multiple sources (CSV files, databases, etc.).
- **Data Transformation**: Cleans and transforms data to ensure quality and consistency.
- **Data Loading**: Loads the processed data into a target database or data warehouse.
- **Error Handling**: Includes mechanisms for logging and managing errors during ETL processes.
